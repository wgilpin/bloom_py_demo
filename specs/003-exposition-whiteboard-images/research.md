# Research: Exposition Whiteboard Images

**Date**: 2025-11-27  
**Status**: To Be Completed

## Overview

This document will consolidate research findings for implementing whiteboard image generation alongside text expositions.

## Research Areas

### 1. Image Generation Services
- Evaluate available image generation services
- Compare quality, cost, and performance
- Assess prompt engineering requirements for educational diagrams

### 2. Image Storage Strategy
- Determine optimal storage approach (database vs. file system)
- Evaluate storage requirements and scaling
- Plan cache invalidation and versioning strategy

### 3. Progressive Loading UX
- Research best practices for progressive content loading
- Design loading indicators and fallback experiences
- Plan error handling and graceful degradation

### 4. Visual Learning Effectiveness
- Review educational research on visual aids for mathematics
- Identify best practices for whiteboard-style educational diagrams
- Consider accessibility requirements for images

### 5. Integration Points
- Identify where image generation integrates with exposition generation
- Plan synchronization between text and image caching
- Design admin controls for cache management

## Decisions

To be documented during planning phase.
